# Diabetics-Prediction
I've developed a Diabetics Prediction application that's designed to help individuals assess their risk of developing diabetes. Using a combination of Python libraries like Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly, along with machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn, this application offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface.

Users input their health data, including factors like blood glucose levels, BMI, age, and family history of diabetes. Then, the application uses these inputs to predict the likelihood of diabetes occurrence. Through interactive charts and graphs, users can easily interpret the results and take proactive measures to manage their health.

My goal with this project is to empower individuals with valuable insights into their health risks and encourage preventive actions, ultimately contributing to improved well-being and quality of life.
